A Read Only Microservice. Exposes an api to search an example resource called Publication

This service is part of an example of the CQRS pattern. IT consumes events producced from commands on a write microservice

This project is meant to improve the scalability limits of the single datase version. You can find it on my repo ``publications-rw``.
